The instructions for the program are at the start of the program but either way here they are:

1. Enter coordinates of the place You want to visit
2. Enter the radius
3. Select the category and subcategory of the sort of place you want to find
4. Sort elements and get the full information about the attractions
5. Option to export  the information as a csv file

Also, open the whole foulder while using the program (in the code editor), otherwise you will get an error while trying to acess the categories.txt file
