# ESP32 Flash Image Loader for Ghidra

This extension allows you to import ESP32 flash images into Ghidra.
It can load either a full flash image with the bootloader and application or just the application part.

In both cases, the image will be fully loaded into Ghidra with the correct address offsets and annotations.
Additionally, the extension will load the ESP32 peripherals and their registers from the SVD files provided by
Espressif.
The ROM code for the associated ESP32 chip will also be loaded into Ghidra, so the code can be properly analyzed.

It also includes several SVD-related scripts

## Supported ESP32 chips:

- ESP32
- ESP32-S2
- ESP32-C3
